# SOFTWARE_PRINCIPLES

The principles that we take behind us while developing projects or programming sometimes make our lives easier, and sometimes open our horizons and imagination. When we apply these principles, our projects become more organized, developable and understandable.

In fact, OOP alone cannot function without these principles. Thanks to these principles, they achieve their purpose and complement each other.

Solid principles are the most important part of our software principles, but before that, we have some principles that should be our principle in software development that should be known.

These principles are :

## Kiss Principle : Keep it Simple Stupid

KISS is a principle that suggests striving for simplicity.This principle, which was first expressed in the American navy in the 1960s, is one of the most important programming principles today. Suggests choosing the simplest and most straightforward solution possible when solving a problem.
KISS rejects the idea that complex solutions are more "intelligent" solutions. Most engineers/programmers think they are doing "intelligent" work by finding complex solutions and building complex structures. A person looking from the outside thinks that the harder he understands, the more added value he produces. But the challenge is to simplify. In software processes, the code/software architecture tends to grow and become more complex over time. The important and difficult thing is to provide the desired functionality at the minimum complexity level.
